    <h1>My nifty little experiments</h1>
    <p>I like to try new things and to challenge myself,
      but sometimes that is hard to do in real projects.</p>

    <p>This is where I put those little experimental exercises
      that I normally throws away, but someone may find them interesting.</p>

    <h2>Exercises</h2>
